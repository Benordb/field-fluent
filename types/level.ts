Comprehension: Understands short, basic sentences on familiar topics if they are clearly stated and possibly accompanied by visuals.
Interaction: Communicates using memorized expressions; often resorts to gestures or first language if outside of known vocabulary.
Vocabulary Guidelines
Range: Everyday, high-frequency words (e.g., “house,” “car,” “friend,” “eat,” “like,” “sleep,” “walk,” etc.).
Scope: Focus on concrete nouns, verbs, and very simple adjectives (e.g., “big,” “small,” “happy,” “sad”).
Avoid: Idiomatic expressions, advanced or specialized terminology, complex phrasal verbs.
Grammar & Sentence Structure
Tenses: Primarily simple present, occasional simple past.
